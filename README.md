# Rapport

Rapport is an elegant meeting assistant and chat system used to save records and come to a general consensus during meetings.

During long meetings it can sometimes be difficult to get a set decision from all stakeholders, and recall the fine details. For each meeting created, Rapport will contain a one-to-one relationship of topics and chatrooms. In each chatroom, stakeholders can type up notes or summaries and each message gets saved to a MongoDB database for future reference. This will aid in remembering specific decisions right to the smallest detail. Additionally, in the near future, Rapport will contain a voting system for each topic so that everybody's voice will be heard for all decisions.

Rapport uses the following technologies: Node.js, Socket.io, MongoDB, Express.js, and ReactJS.
